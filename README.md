# Soviet Ethnography Shiny App

R Shiny app visualizing co-occurrences of ethnographic categories and political narratives about the Tajik SSR in the Soviet journal "Sovetskaya Etnografiya" between 1953 and 1991. I designed this app to facilitate explorative analysis of co-occurrence data generated as part of my master's thesis "Socialist Visions and Imperial Categories. A Digital History of Soviet Ethnographies of the Tajik SSR, 1953-1991."
